Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: an instance variable is used when we are trying to access a class in Ruby. Compared to the other varible, its like an assigment to a specific value

  Your answer: it doesn't have have a 'return', but end

  Researched answer: Every block in ruby will return the value of the last line automatically



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming? *need to understand this better!

  Your answer: OOP is based of classes and objects (key:value pairs) With functional programming, in some way its more diverse, it allows us to manage other things excepts for classes and objects

  Researched answer: In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects and it can only be transformed by creating functions. In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: the class is the blueprint for the object. Without the class, the object wouldn't really work or exist

  Researched answer: A class is a template for objects. ... An object is a member or an "instance" of a class.




6. STRETCH: What is `attr_accessor`?

  Your answer: it allows us to do the getter and setters at the same time

  Researched answer: In Ruby, attr_accessor automatically sets up getters and setters for instance variables. Using attr_accessor allows us to set and get values from outside of the class.
